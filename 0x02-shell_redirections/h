me  matches shell pattern pattern.  The metacharac‐
              ters do not treat `/' or `.' specially; so, for example,
                        find . -path "./sr*sc"
              will print an entry for a directory called `./src/misc' (if
              one  exists).  To ignore a whole directory tree, use -prune
              rather than checking every file in the tree.  Note that the
              pattern match test applies to the whole file name, starting
              from one of the start points named on the command line.  It
              would  only make sense to use an absolute path name here if
              the relevant start point is also an  absolute  path.   This
              means that this command will never match anything:
                        find bar -path /foo/bar/myfile -print
              Find  compares the -path argument with the concatenation of
              a directory name and the base name of the file it's examin‐
              ing.   Since the concatenation will never end with a slash,
              -path arguments  ending  in  a  slash  will  match  nothing
              (except  perhaps  a  start  point  specified on the command
              line).  The predicate -path is also supported by HP-UX find
              and is part of the POSIX 2008 standard.
